I got bored today and decided I needed a tool to let readers search my {{site.posts | size}} blog posts. Writing my own backend API and such was too tedious so I got inspiration from the [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) and decided to look into Algolia. Lukily for me, the kind folks at Algolia have already created a [Jekyll tool](https://github.com/algolia/jekyll-algolia) for me to use!

In this post I will talk you through my installation and implementation of Algolia.

{% include toc.md %}

## Backend

### Setup

Just add `jekyll-algolia` to your Gemfile like so

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-algolia'
end
```

and run `bundle install`. The next step is to configure the plugin to work with the Algolia API in order to _index_ your posts. For this you have to provide your account credentials. Luckily for you there is a [free community tier](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up/hacker)!

You can find your credentials at [algolia.com/account/api-keys/](https://www.algolia.com/account/api-keys/) and place them into your `_config.yml`.

```yaml
algolia:
  application_id: your_application_id
  index_name:     jekyll # Customize
  public_key:     search_only_api_key
```

Another (optional) step is to exclude some files. The default behaviour is to index all markdown and html files. I chose to exclude a few by adding `files_to_exclude: ['blog.html', 'atom.html', 'index.html', '404.html']` to the `algolia` section of my `config.yml`. This allows me to only provide search in the blog posts on my website.

The next, and final step in the **backend** set-up, is to run `ALGOLIA_API_KEY='admin_api_key' bundle exec jekyll algolia`.

### Continuous Deployment

Running a single command every time there is a change to my blog is *tedious* and involves effort. So, as a good developer, I automatically want to automate as much as possible. Luckily, I've already set up a CD workflow on Github which makes this **very** easy for me. If you would like to do something similar, checkout my configuration file [here](https://github.com/iwishiwasaneagle/janhendrikewers.uk/blob/master/.github/workflows/cd.yml)

To implement the auto-indexing, I add

```yaml
- name: "Auto-index website"
  run: ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${{ secrets.ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY }} bundle exec jekyll algolia
```

to the end of my `Deploy` job, to ensure that the index is uploaded once everything is properly deployed.

## Frontend

Indexes are uploaded, the website is updated. Now the only thing that remains is implementing a functional search box... yikes. [`Autocomplete`](https://www.algolia.com/doc/ui-libraries/autocomplete/introduction/what-is-autocomplete/) is to the rescue!

### Installation

We'll use the [jsDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN to install Autocomplete along with the classic theme:

```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/algoliasearch@4.5.1/dist/algoliasearch-lite.umd.js" integrity="sha256-EXPXz4W6pQgfYY3yTpnDa3OH8/EPn16ciVsPQ/ypsjk=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@algolia/autocomplete-js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@algolia/autocomplete-theme-classic"
    />
```

### Implementation

Next, initialize the library, with your Angolia account **PUBLIC API KEY** where ever makes sense. That location is `header.html` for me since my search box is/will be there.

{% raw %}
```html
<script>
  const searchClient = algoliasearch(
    '{{ site.algolia.application_id }}',
    '{{site.algolia.public_key}}',
  );
</script>
```
{% endraw %}

Next we must import Autocomplete with `const { autocomplete, getAlgoliaResults } = window['@algolia/autocomplete-js'];`.

Now we're ready to add the search box. Add a div with an id to your html, like `<div id='autcomplete'></div>`. This is where the search bar will be.

Back in your `<script>`, we add the bellow code:

{% raw %}
```js
autocomplete({
    container: '#autocomplete',
    placeholder: 'Search for posts',
  getSources({ query }) {
    return [
      {
        sourceId: 'posts',
        getItems() {
          return getAlgoliaResults({
            searchClient,
            queries: [
              {
                indexName: '{{ site.algolia.index_name }}',
                query,
                params: {
                  hitsPerPage: 5,
                  snippetEllipsisText: 'â€¦',
                },
              },
            ],
          });
        },
        templates: {
          item({ item, createElement, components }) {
            return createElement('div', null,
              createElement('a', { href: item.url, class: "text-decoration-none text-body" },
                components.Highlight({ hit: item, attribute: 'title', tagName: 'strong' })
              ),
            );
          },
          noResults(){
            return 'No Results';
          }
        },
      },
    ]
  }      
});
```
{% endraw %}

It may seem daunting at first, but the API is quite intuitive upon closer inspection. `getItem` gets the items, `templates` provides templates for how to return results, `noResults` is what shows when there are no results. The [documentation for Autocomplete](https://www.algolia.com/doc/ui-libraries/autocomplete/core-concepts/basic-configuration-options/) is surprisingly good so do check it out, as anything I write here pales in comparison to their efforts.

## Conclusion

Algolia has built a very excellent set of tools for us casuals to play around with. There is no surprise why I'm seeing the "powered by Algolia" tag left, right and centre. I tried getting on the [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) program but was sadly rejected as they are prioritizing technical documentation websites first (see [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs)).

At the time of writing this post, I have 3 published blog posts so it works very well 100% of the time as all posts are being shown. It wil be interesting to see how my setup scales over time.
