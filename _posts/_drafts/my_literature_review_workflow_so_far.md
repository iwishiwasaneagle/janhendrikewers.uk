I'm approaching the 1 month anniversary of starting my PhD ðŸ¥³. As I approach this seemingly insignificant milestone relative to the 3-year committent I have made to my project, I wanted to take some time to write about my paper reading workflow so far. This is most likely going to change down the line and having a blog post to come back to and compare will be really interesting for me.

## What software do I use?
