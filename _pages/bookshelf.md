A long long time ago I was a huge bookworm but since starting
university in 2016 I barely touched a book. I've been wanting to get 
back into reading for a while since graduating in 2021. To get into 
this habit, I've set myself a challenge to read my books rather than 
aimlessly scroll on my phone at lunchtime.

Taking inspiration from
[Petar Gyurov](https://petargyurov.com/bookshelf/), I've
opted to keep track of my reads list via this virtual bookshelf which
also incentivises me to keep growing my read list.

So from 2022 onwards, I intend to track every book read here. Enjoy!
