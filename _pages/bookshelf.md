A long long time ago I was a _huuuge_ bookworm but since starting
university in 2016 I have barely touched a book other than a
text-book. I've been wanting to get back into reading for a while
since graduating in 2021. To get into this habit, I've set myself a
challenge to read my books rather than aimlessly scroll on my phone at
lunchtime.

Taking inspiration from
[Petar Gyurov](https://petargyurov.com/bookshelf/), I've
opted to keep track of my reads list via this virtual bookshelf which
also incentivises me to keep growing my read list.

This list isn't complete as it does not include the hundreds of books
I read as a teenager, but it is a clean slate to start from.
